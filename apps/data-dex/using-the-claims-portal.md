# Using the claims Portal

The Claims Portal is a critical component of Itheum's protocol, and its role is to oversee the automated token distributions that are the outcome of ecosystem usage activity. It facilitates direct token distribution schemes within the Itheum ecosystem, coordinating exchanges between Data Creators, Data Consumers, and Data Coalition DAOs. It enables the fair distribution of tokens among participants, making it a crucial building block for the Itheum platform's community growth and governance. You can learn more about the Claims Portal in this [blog post](https://medium.com/itheum-newsletter/itheums-token-distribution-nucleus-the-claims-portal-is-now-live-on-the-elrond-mainnet-e5717c3827b6).
