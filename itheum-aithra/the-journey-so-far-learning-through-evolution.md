# The Journey So Far - Learning Through Evolution

Since its inception in 2018, Itheum has constantly evolved through industry cycles, guided by a single goal: to empower people and organizations to own, control, and trade their data. Each version of Itheum was a reflection of the technological and cultural moment - and each brought lessons that shaped the next.

### V0 (2018): Web2 Health Data Ownership&#x20;

Our first version tackled healthcare data ownership, letting patients collect and control their data in encrypted Web2 stores. We learned that while healthcare was ripe for disruption, Web2 ecosystems resist data ownership - control was deeply institutional.

### V1 (2022): Data DEX and the Metaverse Narrative

We launched a Data DEX and Data NFTs, allowing creative and professional data assets to be traded. The idea resonated in the early Web3 world, winning/placing in multiple hackathons (Polygon, Hedera, FileCoin, Ivan on Tech’s web3 hackathon etc) and partnerships. Yet, as the NFT and metaverse narratives cooled, we realized timing and user adoption were everything.

### V2 (2024): Data for the AI Era

We pivoted to “Bulk Data” Data NFTs for AI training, gaming, and music - alongside NFMe ID and Liveliness Staking for proof of humanity. Our tech was recognized globally (Sony Web3 Accelerator finalist, Solana Summit hackathon top 5 winner). But as decentralized AI hype faded, adoption slowed.

### Key Learnings

Across all versions, we learned the vital importance of timing, market fit, and cultural readiness. The idea of data ownership is powerful, but to find true product-market fit, it must align with where the world is heading.
