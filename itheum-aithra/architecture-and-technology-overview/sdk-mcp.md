# SDK / MCP

Whilst the Aithra Workspace is aimed at human users, all features provided by the UI will also be available via an SDK for developer access, allowing you to build your own data workflows within your apps. An MCP server will also be provided to offer an agentic-friendly interface for AI agents to autonomously generate hyper-digital data assets.
