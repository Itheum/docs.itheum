# Architecture and Technology Overview

The **Infra Layer** is the **OSS (Open Source) / Public Goods** protocol layer that is open for all to use via web3 native permissionless, self-custody rails. The **Infra Layer** abstracts multiple distributed **3rd party protocols** (tools and blockchains) and serves as the **Abstraction + Unification** Interface for the protocol features offered by Itheum Aithra. **Platform governance** of the **Infra Layer** will be offered by the **$ITHEUM token**.&#x20;

Usage of the **Infra Layer** will require payment via stablecoins and network tokens like SOL, SUI, and USDC, with payments depending on the service you require (e.g. storage + IP + Privacy) along with other metrics like data size (in MB/GB) and/or length of service contract (monthly, yearly or longer – like decades).&#x20;

The **Infra Layer** is a web3 native interface, allowing for both autonomous consumption (e.g. via on-chain AI agents) and for consumer (human) consumption (via apps or tooling) built on top of the core protocol. We will offer a **Workspace UI**, which is a web app that allows anyone to access the features via simple user experience, and we will also aim to offer a **SDK / MCP** for developers and AI Agents to use the features of Itheum Aithra.&#x20;

The **distribution layer** is how we aim to encourage and incentivise growth of the Itheum Aithra’s Infra Layer. This **distribution layer** will consist of various public built **Consumer Apps** that offer features powered by Itheum Aithra capabilities. **Sigma Music** (for e.g.) is a web2 music platform that offers **Music, Fan Tokens and Collectibles** and **AI Remix Licensing**, and these 2 product features are powered by Itheum Aithra capabilities and **Agenta**, another consumer app in development, has a feature called **Sovereign Data Vaults**, powered by Itheum Aithra.&#x20;

Consumer Apps can use **Workspace UI** and **SDK / MCP** directly to build, but these web2 companies may have specific constraints, e.g. not handle payment via crypto, have region based data storage compliance needs or have a need for 24/7 custom/tech support (like like any other tech platform) – to accommodate these “web2” style tech platform requirements, **Itheum Gateways** will offer web2 friendly onboarding and **enterprise-grade abstraction** for companies looking to explore the deep tech offered by itheum Aithra. **Itheum Gateways** are also an opportunity for web2 tech companies to get exposure to and to “re-sell” web3 tech offered by Itheum Aithra. This close symbiotic relationship between the Infra Layer and the distribution layer is well positioned to help drive growth.
