# Itheum Aithra – Community FAQ

## 1. Will Data NFTs still function on MultiversX?

**Yes**. The Data Streams behind each minted Data NFT are maintained by their original data creators. Many of the early Data Streams tied to MultiversX Data NFTs have already been disabled by their creators, meaning those NFTs have effectively downgraded into standard NFTs.\
\
Newer Data NFTs - for example, those used in music applications - that rely on decentralized storage continue to work. It’s important to understand that decentralized data streams aren’t designed to live forever; most decentralized storage networks recycle unused space over time.\
\
In short: as long as your Data NFTs are active and being used, they will continue to function.

## 2. How can I use my Data NFTs if the Data DEX and Explorer are reaching EOS?

The decision to move the Data DEX and Explorer to **End-of-Support (EOS)** was primarily based on very low usage of these tools. However, the Data NFTs themselves remain fully functional as standard NFTs.\
\
If you wish to open or interact with a Data NFT without those UIs, you can use the Itheum SDK to build a small script to unlock and load your data: [Documentation](https://docs.itheum.io/product-docs/developers/software-development-kits-sdks/data-nft-sdk/guide-2-unlocking-data-nfts-via-multiversx-native-auth.)\
\
Additionally, ecosystem tools like xFabric continue to support certain Data NFT types (e.g., Music NFTs). So long as those third-party integrations exist, older Data NFTs can still be accessed and consumed.

## 5. Is the $ITHEUM token itself reaching End-of-Life (EOS)?

Absolutely not - $ITHEUM remains at the heart of the protocol.\
\
What’s changing is its role: the most sustainable and meaningful utility for network tokens today is governance - giving the community influence over protocol direction. We’re aligning the $ITHEUM token with this evolved purpose, focusing on long-term maturity and sustainability.\
\
That said, additional utilities can be proposed and reintroduced by community vote at any time - for example, a future reactivation of the Liveliness concept as a proof-of-reputation layer.

## 6. Will there be any $ITHEUM token buybacks?

Usage of the [open-source infrastructure ](https://docs.itheum.io/product-docs/getting-started/architecture-and-technology-overview)will generate revenue in crypto-native network tokens such as SOL, SUI, and USDC. A portion of these funds will be allocated toward protocol operations and builder grants. Another portion may be used for buybacks and burns, depending on governance decisions.\
\
In essence, as protocol usage grows, the entire ecosystem benefits

## 7. Aithra is the evolution of Itheum, not a separate project, right?

Exactly. Aithra is simply the name of the Itheum V3 protocol release - it’s not a new product and does not introduce a new token. The $ITHEUM token remains the core governance and coordination asset of the Itheum ecosystem.

## 8. Is Itheum removing support for MultiversX?

No - Itheum is not removing support for MultiversX and has always been a multi-chain protocol.\
\
Much of our V1 and V2 tech stack - including smart contracts deployed on MultiversX - remains active and immutable. Our most innovative feature, the Data DEX (a market place for data trading) has all its smart contracts deployed in MultiversX (which can be stood up again in future if a Data Marketplace meta emerges). Also, our deepest liquidity still exists on xExchange, and we continue to value that ecosystem.\
\
What’s changing is that certain UI tools (like the Data DEX and Explorer) are being retired due to low usage, some of these tools are on MultilversX but some are also on Solana (e.g. Liveliness Staking + NFMe ID) Meanwhile, [newer tools](https://docs.itheum.io/product-docs/getting-started/architecture-and-technology-overview) are being built on chains like SUI, Story, and Solana to support Aithra’s new advanced features (e.g., encryption, tokenization, IP licensing).\
\
This is expansion - not departure. Itheum continues to grow across multiple ecosystems.

## 9. What will $ITHEUM holders be able to vote on?

Examples of governance items that may be proposed include:\
• Burning of remaining uncirculated supply\
• Allocation of revenue from the public-goods infra layer (e.g., % between buybacks, grants, operations)\
• Decisions to bridge to new chains\
• Adjustments to protocol fees, or curation rules for ecosystem tools\
\
We believe web3 will return to its cypherpunk roots, where governance becomes the most valuable and enduring utility of a network token. $ITHEUM enables shared ownership and decision-making over the protocol’s future.

## 10. Are we moving from “Data Ownership for People” to “Infrastructure for AI”?

Our mission has always been to help people own and earn from their data. That hasn’t changed - it’s simply evolving with the market.\
\
The reality is that most individuals today still give away their data freely to social platforms or AI apps in exchange for convenience. True data ownership hasn’t yet reached mainstream cultural value - but it will.\
\
As we await that inflection point, we’re directing our tech toward where data ownership already matters: the AI and AGI frontier. By powering privacy, encryption, and IP licensing for AGI-era data, we’re laying the groundwork for a world where humans ultimately benefit, too.\
\
When data sovereignty becomes non-negotiable and not optional - Itheum will already be there.

## 11. Many Web3 native projects are shutting down as the crypto industry has m. Is there a risk that Itheum is heading down this path?

Not at all. Itheum isn’t shutting down - we’re evolving.\
\
Deep-tech projects often face long journeys to product–market fit because they build for the future, not the present. Our focus is on staying alive, adapting, and learning until the timing and culture align.\
\
We’ve seen this pattern across the industry:\
• Zcash (ZEC), which persisted for years before the recent privacy renaissance.\
• NEAR Protocol, which found new life through NEAR Intents.\
• AI itself - decades in research before exploding into mainstream awareness.\
\
Itheum is following that same playbook. We’re laying the rails for a coming shift where data becomes the world’s most valuable asset. That shift hasn’t fully arrived - but when it does, Itheum will be ready.

## 12. Who will use the new products you are building?

Our [new products](https://docs.itheum.io/product-docs/getting-started/architecture-and-technology-overview) are designed for **real-world use cases** in AI and data-driven industries. We’re positioning them as **practical data infrastructure tools**, not futuristic blockchain experiments that no one knows how to use.

Products like the [**Aithra Workspace UI**](https://docs.itheum.io/product-docs/getting-started/architecture-and-technology-overview/workspace-ui) and our [**SDK/MCP**](https://docs.itheum.io/product-docs/getting-started/architecture-and-technology-overview/sdk-mcp) will allow anyone to create **hyper-digital data assets** — ideal for industries such as **AI training, music, and media**, where IP sensitivity and data ownership are critical.

Through **Itheum Gateways**, businesses can also commercialize and integrate our technology much like any other web2 solution — with enterprise-friendly onboarding, compliance options, and familiar business models. We are already seeing [this enterprise adoption emerging slowing but steadly](https://docs.itheum.io/product-docs/getting-started/building-the-ecosystem-consumer-apps-and-distribution)

This evolution moves Itheum from a deep-web3 focus toward a broader **web2 and enterprise audience** — a deliberate repositioning to make our technology usable, scalable, and commercially relevant.

Our long-term goal is to make Itheum the **full-stack abstraction and unification layer** for hyper-digital data creation and monetization — a model we believe will become essential as the world runs out of accessible AI training data and needs new technology to unlock richer, permissioned, and higher-quality datasets.
