# Commercialization Model and Token Utility

Itheum remains open-source public goods infrastructure. However, Aithra introduces a commercial layer - the Itheum Gateway. This allows Web2 companies to integrate the tech via enterprise pathways (tools and APIs), similar to how Red Hat commercialized Linux. Payments for public-goods infra layer usage support stablecoins and network tokens like SOL, SUI, and USDC, whereas, Itheum Gateway will support more web2 payment rails like USD, Credit Cards etc.



### $ITHEUM Token : Transitioning to a Governance Token

The $ITHEUM token transitions into a governance-focused role. Its utility centers on decision-making for open-source direction, roadmap and public goods funding and ecosystem benefits (e.g. grants to build). To enhance credibility and scarcity, additional tokens will be burned soon (pending a DAO vote), reducing total supply and strengthening token economics. The new burn will be announced as part of our “Burn Program” procedure, which involves a proposal and DAO vote. As you may know, a Phase 1 Burn was concluded and resulted in the burn of 150,000,000 $ITHEUM tokens already. See [here](../protocol/token-burning/):&#x20;
