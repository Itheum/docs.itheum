# Sunsetting Earlier Versions (V0–V2)

The web3 landscape evolves rapidly, and so must we. To sharpen our focus on Aithra, we are “hibernating” older Itheum versions. These products, while important milestones, will now move to **End-of-Support (EOS)** status. Smart contracts remain immutable and will persist, demonstrating the resilience of Web3.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Will these products disappear forever?**\
No, most of these products are just UI layers over smart contracts and we are EOSing them due to low usage in the current market environment. We can always re-hydrate them if broader web3 market metas evolve.
