# How to view a Trailblazer

The owner of an Itheum Trailblazer can choose to view the raw data of the Data NFT or explore an intuitive interface that presents the Data Stream in a more absorbable format. This refined view is available on the [Itheum Explorer](../../apps/itheum-explorer.md). Once you procure a data NFT you can either:

**I. View Raw Data on the Data Dex:**

1. Visit the [Data Dex](https://datadex.itheum.io/), login and browse to the wallet section, you will be able to view your data NFT here.
