# Data Streams Guides

Data Streams are dynamic data streams published by organizations or individuals and are hosted to exist in the web2 world (accessible via a web browser). But these streams can be wrapped behind a Data NFT, which then serves as the "license key" to unlock the Data Stream.

Unlike traditional "token gated experiences," we see in the world today, where an NFT unlocks a "secret web link" or "file" inside a centralized website or app, Data Streams via Data NFTs allow for the entire Data Stream to be portable to any website or app. This effectively enables fully portable "token gated experiences" where the user with the Data NFT can go to any website or app that supports Data NFT technology in order to unlock and share the data inside the stream.

The Data NFT holder would have the right to access and use the Data Stream. These Data Streams can be accessed in raw format via the Data DEX or Data Explorer or programmatically via Itheum [Data NFT SDK](../../developers/software-development-kits-sdks/data-nft-sdk/).

Anyone can host a Data Stream themselves, enabling them to follow their own "data regulation or sovereignty" needs based on their industry or location. But to assist you with getting started, we have written some guides that walk you through some automation tools and scripts that create and host a Data Stream.&#x20;

You can use our guides to set up and automate a Data Stream URL that will then be used to mint the Data NFT.&#x20;

But before we jump into the guides on hosting, launching, and automating Data Stream using various platforms like AWS (for centralized Data Stream) and Arweave (for decentralized Data Stream), let's begin with some general-purpose rules for Data Stream URLs.
