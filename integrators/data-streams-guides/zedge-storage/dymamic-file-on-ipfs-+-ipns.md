# Dymamic File on IPFS + IPNS

## Target User Story:

{% hint style="info" %}
As a user who wants to mint a Data NFT:

* I'd like to store a dynamic file on IPFS using Zedge Storage
* I'd like to then grab the IPNS identifier of this file and mint a Data NFT with a URL like "ipns://MY\_IPNS\_ID"
* I'd then like to come back to Zedge Storage, and update my data as I know "ipns://MY\_IPNS\_ID" will now point to my new updated IPFS CID
{% endhint %}
