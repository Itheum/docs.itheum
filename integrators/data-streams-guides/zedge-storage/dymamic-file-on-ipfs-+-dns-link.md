# Dymamic File on IPFS + DNS Link

## Target User Story:

{% hint style="info" %}
As a user who wants to mint a Data NFT:

* I'd like to store a dynamic file on IPFS using Zedge Storage and get it's IPFS CID
* I'd like to then use DNS Link to connect my domain name (my-domain.com) to my IPFS CID to this domain name
* I'd then like to come back to Zedge Storage, update my data and then change the connected CID on my domain name so that my domain points to the new file
{% endhint %}
