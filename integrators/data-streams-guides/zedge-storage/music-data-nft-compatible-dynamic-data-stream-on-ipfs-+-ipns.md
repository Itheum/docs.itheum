# Music Data NFT Compatible Dynamic Data Stream on IPFS + IPNS

Target User Story:

{% hint style="info" %}
As a user who wants to mint a Music Data NFT:

* I'd like to use Zedge Storage to mint my music files (multiple songs) in a Data Stream that's compatible with a Web3 Music Player like [NF-Tunes](https://explorer.itheum.io/nftunes)
* I'd like to then grab the IPNS identifier of this music Data Stream and mint a Data NFT with a URL like "ipns://MY\_IPNS\_ID"
* I'd then like to come back to Zedge Storage, and update my data as I know "ipns://MY\_IPNS\_ID" will now point to my new updated IPFS CID



\[Note that the above use-case can also be done using DNS Link, as shown in the demo video below]
{% endhint %}
