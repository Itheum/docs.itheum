# Trailblazer Data NFT Compatible Dynamic Data Stream on IPFS + IPNS

Target User Story:

{% hint style="info" %}
As a user who wants to mint a Trailblazer Data NFT (which is a format that generates a historical view of events or information) like the [Time Capsule](https://explorer.itheum.io/timecapsule) or [Itheum's TrailBlazer Quest platform](https://explorer.itheum.io/project-trailblazer)

* I'd like to use Zedge Storage to mint my links in a Data Stream that's compatible with a Trailblazer
* I'd like to then grab the IPNS identifier of this Data Stream and mint a Data NFT with a URL like "ipns://MY\_IPNS\_ID"
* I'd then like to come back to Zedge Storage, and update my data as I know "ipns://MY\_IPNS\_ID" will now point to my new updated IPFS CID



\[Note that the above use-case can also be done using DNS Link]
