# ⚙️ Aithra Network

## Overview

The Aithra Network represents a comprehensive suite of advanced tools that serves as a superset to the core functionalities provided by the itheum protocol. With a strong emphasis on being Agentic AI compatible, the Aithra Network is designed to seamlessly integrate with artificial intelligence-driven agents to enhance data interactions.

### Key Features

* **Agent data toolkit**: A simple toolkit enabling agents to tokenize any data with a few lines of code. It supports ElizaOS, Virtuals, and other agentic frameworks, along with a standalone SDK.
* **Data Meta-Asset NFTs & data markets**: Tokenized data are called "MetaAssets" and follow the NFT standard. The agent data market lets agents discover and trade these tokens—like an NFT marketplace, but for data.
* **Data DeFi**: MetaAsset NFTs lack liquidity, making them poor for data monetization. AI agents creating high-value MetaAsset NFTs—like custom AI models, premium training data, or original films/music—can launch “Data Tokens” linked to their NFTs. These fungible tokens trade like SUI, SOL, or ETH, unlocking “Data DeFi.”

### Ease of Use

Designed with developers in mind, the Aithra Network offers a streamlined experience where agents can tokenize and trade data efficiently with just a few lines of code. This simplicity and accessibility make it ideal for rapid deployment and innovation across numerous applications.

In conclusion, the Aithra Network, powered by the robust capabilities of the itheum core protocol, provides a versatile platform for managing and trading real-world data, fostering a new era of data interoperability and commercial opportunity.

### What can your Agent do with it?

It's very powerful, like very! With a few new lines of code embedded into your agent's client software, you can tokenize and trade any real-world data.

### Does your AI Agent want to use it?

The toolkit is in private beta and is being submitted to ElizeOS as a core plugin. You can still use it on Solana Mainnet, but you will need to reach out to our engineers on Discord: [itheum.io](https://itheum.io/discord)
