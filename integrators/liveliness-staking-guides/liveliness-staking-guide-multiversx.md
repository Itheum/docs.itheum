# Liveliness Staking Guide : MultiversX

Users can earn staking rewards for the Combined Liveliness (bonded ITHEUM) on all their Data NFTs. All Data NFTs are a fixed "minimum bond", to maximize your staking rewards you can also have a NFMe.ID Vault Data NFT, a special Data NFT that can be topped up. Let's explore.

In the below sections we will dive into:&#x20;

1. Minting an NFMe.ID Vault: A user simply mints their NFMe vault. Users can mint multiple NFMe.id Vaults
2. Minting a data NFT and setting it as the primary.
3. Claiming rewards from bonding.

### I. Mint an NFMe.id Vault

In this section we will cover minting of a NFMe.id Vault. Please follow the below instructions:

1. Navigate to the [minting page](https://datadex.itheum.io/mintdata)
