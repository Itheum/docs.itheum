# Appointer > Delegator Pattern for Data NFT Delegation

A upgrade that allows Smart Contracts the ability to manage and control Data NFTs.

The system works in an "Appointer > Delegator" design. The Appointer is a smart contract that will hold Data NFTs. It exposes the public `viewDeputyAddress` method that returns the Address of an appointed "deputy" that can Open the Data NFTs the Appointer smart contract holds.&#x20;
