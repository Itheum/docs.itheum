# MultiversX Blockchain

Itheum's technology has been deployed to the MultiversX Blockchain's Devnet and Mainnet.

The Devnet is the perfect testing ground for new users and integrators to test Itheum's technology without spending on real gas or tokens, while the Mainnet implementation can tap into the economic and security guarantees required for real-world usage.

Itheum is a core project of the MultiversX Blockchain and was [launched by the official launchpad in early 2022](https://xlaunchpad.com/itheum/project-overview).
