# Data NFT Streaming Automation - Trailblazer

**Brief:**

For the purpose of minting a TrailBlazer Data NFT, the minter is required to provide a Data Stream URL. Below is a brief on how a user can set up an automation sequence. The user can upload a CSV via this process and consequently update the CSV to reflect directly in the stream. The below process uploads the CSV stream, processing it into JSON format to AWS. The link can then be used to Mint the Trailblazer Data NFT.

**Requirements:**

* GitHub account (create one if needed)
* AWS account (create one if needed)
* Git and GitHub CLI installed locally
* Python script that generates output files

**Steps:**

1. Initial Git setup and GitHub account login:
   * Set up Git on your local machine and log in to Git using your GitHub account credentials.
2. Create an AWS S3 bucket:
   * If you don't already have an AWS S3 bucket, create one as part of the setup process.
3. Create a GitHub repository:
   * Use the [provided template](https://github.com/Itheum/template-datastream-aws-s3-trailblazer) to create a GitHub repository.
   * Clone the repository to your local machine for further configuration.
4. Set up secrets in your Github repo to access AWS:
   * In the repository's "Secrets and variables" section, configure three secrets:
     * S3\_BUCKET\_NAME: Provide the name of your AWS S3 bucket.
     * S3\_KEY\_ID: Set the AWS S3 access key ID.
     * S3\_ACCESS\_KEY: Set the AWS S3 access key.
5. Customize the script:
   * Adjust your Python script according to the provided template.
   * Ensure that the output files generated by the script are saved in the "output" folder of the repository.
6. Push changes to GitHub:
   * Push your script changes to the GitHub repository.
   * This action triggers the GitHub Action, which automatically runs the script daily at 23:30 UTC or whenever new code is pushed.

In this process, the CSV file is initially uploaded to GitHub. It is then converted to a JSON file and uploaded to the designated AWS S3 bucket, which serves as the stream URL for the data NFT.
