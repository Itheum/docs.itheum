# üêû Bug Bounty

Itheum is a fully open source, omni-chain protocol that's powered by multiple open source smart contracts and dapps.

A bug bounty program is being put into place to enable social developers and engineers to responsibly disclose security issues in exchange for a reward.

## Rewards by Threat Level

Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3.](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/) This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.

All bug reports must include a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited to impact an asset-in-scope to be eligible for a reward. Critical and High severity bug reports should also include a suggestion for a fix. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.

Payouts are handled by the **Itheum** team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in **ITHEUM**.

## Rewards

The reward amounts are being finalized, but reach out to us **bugbounty@itheum.io** in the meantime for reward amount specifics.&#x20;
