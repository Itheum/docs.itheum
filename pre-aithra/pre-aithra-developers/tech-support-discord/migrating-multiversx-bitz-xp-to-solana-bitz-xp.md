# Migrating MultiversX BiTz XP to Solana BiTz XP

Follow these instructions to migrate your MultiversX BiTz XP to Solana.

For the migration to work, we need to know your :

* MultiversX Wallet Address  (Source)
* Your Solana Wallet Address (Destination)
* Verified MultiversX Wallet Address (Source)

{% hint style="warning" %}
We move your  BiTz XP from the "Source" to the "Destination".  Note that we need your "Verified MultiversX Wallet Address" to prevent abuse of the migration (i.e. someone migrating XP from a wallet their DON'T own)
{% endhint %}

**Here is what your need to do:**

1. Go to [.](./ "mention")and open a Support Ticket asking the support admin that you want a XP migration ([https://discord.com/channels/869901313616527360/1249704473287200911](https://discord.com/channels/869901313616527360/1249704473287200911))
2.  In the ticket, along with your MultiversX wallet address and Solana wallet address, we need your **Verified MultiversX Wallet Address (Source).** Here is how you get it
