This Open-Source TypeScript SDK focuses on interacting with the [data-marshal-network.md](../../../data-marshal-network.md "mention"). At a high level, it enables 3rd party developers (enterprises) to utilize the decentralized "data brokerage" node network and get encryption and decryption services, check "data uptime" of Data NFT Data Streams, etc.

The SDK includes the following high-level modules:

1. **Interacting with a Data Marshal node (**[**Class Docs**](https://itheum.github.io/sdk-data-marshal-network/classes/DataMarshal.html)**)**
   * Encrypt a Data Stream
   * Check Uptime of a Data NFT Data Stream
   * ... more
