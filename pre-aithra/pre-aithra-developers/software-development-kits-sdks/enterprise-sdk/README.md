[![npm (scoped)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@itheum/sdk-mx-enterprise?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@itheum/sdk-mx-enterprise)

This Open-Source TypeScript SDK focuses on interacting with [itheum-enterprise.md](../../../pre-aithra-r-and-d/itheum-enterprise.md "mention") technology on the MultiversX blockchain. At a high level, it enables 3rd party developers (enterprises) to build a _semi-private_ Itheum data brokerage layer for custom user cases like publishing platforms, identity protocols, loyalty programs, data vaults etc.

The SDK includes the following high-level modules:

1. **Interacting with the Factory (**[**Class Docs**](https://itheum.github.io/sdk-mx-enterprise/classes/Factory.html)**)**
   * if whitelisted, deploy your own "semi-private" [Data NFT-Lease Minter](https://itheum.github.io/sdk-mx-data-nft/classes/NftMinter.html) and have admin access over it
   * Claim royalties from primary and secondary market trade of your Data NFTs
   * Check for new upgrades in the Factory and upgrade your own Minters Smart Contracts
