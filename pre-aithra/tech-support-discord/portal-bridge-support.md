# Portal Bridge Support

In the event you encounter technical issues when using the [portal-traveler-test-the-itheum-omni-chain-portal-bridge.md](../../protocol/hackathons-and-dev-challenges/community-test-events/portal-traveler-test-the-itheum-omni-chain-portal-bridge.md "mention") to bridge your ITHEUM tokens between MultiversX and Solana, you can use our dedicated Discord channel-based support process as follows:

## Discord Support Process

* Head over to our discord and join it: [https://itheum.io/discord](http://ithem.io/discord)
* Once you pass the verification process, you should see the following "**bridge-support"** channel, and you can then click on "**Open Ticket**"

* A new **private ticket** is created for you where you can communicate privately with the support team
* Describe your issue, enter as much information, and include as many links and screenshots as possible to provide the support team with the right context.&#x20;
* If you are seeking help specifically with "Hold" transactions like the following:

Note that some transactions show as Hold but may have still been processed (check your ITHEUM balances in your native blockchain wallet to confirm), if you confirm that the ITHEUM balance is NOT correct then this might just mean that a sudden spike in blockchain network congestion has caused your transaction to be processed with extra delay. Most legitimate transactions should clear within a few hours once the transaction is reviewed and the hold is cleared.

* But you can "Open Ticket" if you want the support team to follow up on the Hold transaction as well, when you do open a ticket, make sure you enter the Blockchain Explorer link to the Deposit Hash and a screenshot of the UI which shows the transaction on Hold, and then submit the ticket.

* A member of the support team should then respond to your ticket soon and you can close the ticket when the issue has been resolved.
