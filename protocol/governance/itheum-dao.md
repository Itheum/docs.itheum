# Itheum DAO

{% hint style="success" %}
The Itheum DAO is the primary DAO for the Itheum Protocol.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The Itheum DAO is a fully open DAO where the Itheum protocol community can discuss, raise, and vote on proposals that improve the roadmap and growth of the Itheum protocol.

* The DAO runs on PeerMe and can be accessed here: [https://peerme.io/itheum-dao](https://peerme.io/itheum-dao). At this stage, only users with MultiversX $ITHEUM can create and vote on proposals.
* The DAO has a **Vault** that contains tokens available for DAO use. These tokens are part of the Itheum protocol treasury, and the Vault also allows anyone to contribute funds that support the growth and usage of the protocol.
* The DAO uses **token-weighted voting** and is fully open for anyone to participate.
* There is ongoing work to introduce a Solana $ITHEUM-powered DAO as an alternative to the MultiversX Itheum DAO. This will provide **governance redundancy** and move protocol governance fully **on-chain**.
