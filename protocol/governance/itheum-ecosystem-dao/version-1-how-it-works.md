# Version 1: How it Works

Version 1 of Trailblazer DAO is not in its final form of decentralization and will progressively open up its decentralization vectors. Version 1 will have the following characteristics and will be focused on Itheum Life : Creator Bonding governance:

* The DAO runs on PeerMe and can be accessed here (Coming Soon)
* It will be a Multi-Sig based DAO to execute Smart Contract commands that contract Itheum life Creator Bodning mechanism.
* It will have 5 users with an Admin role who can vote and propose changes to the Itheum Life : Creator Bonding (e.g. Bond Amount / Duration) as well as to curate potential bad actors by penalizing and slashing.&#x20;
  * Initially, Admin roles are held by core Itheum protocol contributors + PeerMe contributors
  * Voting is done via a 3 of 5 MultiSig approval or rejection of proposal.
  * All proposals are public
  * In the future, this proposal voting mechanism will be replaced by either Trailblazer Data NFT holders or ITHEUM stakers/holders, etc (TBF)
* It will also have a public "Community" section where anyone can create a "thread". This is the starting point for "community curation of Data NFT and Creators". e.g. Someone in the public wants to raise a concern with a Data NFT that has "downtime" and no data stream active.
  * Once a thread is raised, Admins will initiate some follow-up discussions and if needed take action "e.g. warn and penalize a Data Creator"
