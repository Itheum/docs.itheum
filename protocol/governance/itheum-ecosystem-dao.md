# Itheum Ecosystem DAO

{% hint style="success" %}
The Itheum Ecosystem DAO is an open and transparent DAO that governs curation of data that is part of the Itheum Protocol and you can access it here: [https://peerme.io/itheum-ecosystem-dao](https://peerme.io/itheum-ecosystem-dao)\
\
This DAO is currently not actively used due to low usage of the Itheum protocol in the MultiversX chain.
{% endhint %}

The Ecosystem DAO is a fully open DAO that users of the Itheum protocol can use to discuss, raise and vote on proposals that curate data that is published via the Itheum protocol:

* The DAO runs on PeerMe and can be accessed here [https://peerme.io/itheum-ecosystem-dao](https://peerme.io/itheum-ecosystem-dao) - at this stage, only users with MultiversX $ITHEUM can create and vote on proposals.
* It will also have a public "Community" section where anyone can create a "thread".
* Proposals and voting is powered by [liveliness-on-chain-reputation](../../pre-aithra/liveliness-on-chain-reputation/ "mention")— where you need to bond $ITHEUM tokens to gain Liveliness which you can use for governance &#x20;
