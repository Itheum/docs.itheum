# Itheum Ecosystem DAO

{% hint style="success" %}
The Itheum Ecosystem DAO is an open and transparent DAO that governs key aspects of the Itheum Protocol. and you can access it here: [https://peerme.io/itheum-ecosystem-dao](https://peerme.io/itheum-ecosystem-dao)
{% endhint %}

The Ecosystem DAO is a fully open DAO that users of the Itheum protocol can use to discuss, raise and vote on proposals that improve the roadmap of the Itheum protocol:

* The DAO runs on PeerMe and can be accessed here [https://peerme.io/itheum-ecosystem-dao](https://peerme.io/itheum-ecosystem-dao) - at this stage, only users with MultiversX $ITHEUM can create and vote on proposals. But a chain agnostic system is being worked on to allow DAO governance from users with $ITHEUM on any chain.
* It will also have a public "Community" section where anyone can create a "thread".&#x20;
