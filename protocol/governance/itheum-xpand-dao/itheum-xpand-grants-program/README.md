### Ecosystem Support

The **`Itheum xPand Grants Program`** has allocated $ITHEUM 1,000,000 for ecosystem support. This support is distributed through a multi-level structure to support various projects within the ecosystem.

#### Initial Phase (Program 1)

In the first phase of the program called [program-1-multiversx-post-hackathon-accelerator.md](../program-1-multiversx-post-hackathon-accelerator.md "mention") and is for projects that were “born” out of the [multiversx-xday-hackathon](../../../hackathons-and-dev-challenges/multiversx-xday-hackathon/ "mention"). For more details about the hackathon, please refer to [this link](https://docs.itheum.io/product-docs/developers/hackathon). For hackathon ideas please refer to [this link](https://docs.itheum.io/product-docs/developers/hackathon/project-ideas-greater-than-itheum).

#### **Evaluation Criteria**

Outstanding projects are evaluated on the following parameters:

1. _Original Ideas:_ Assessing the uniqueness and creativity of the project concept, aiming to identify novel ideas within its field.
2. _Innovative:_ Looking for innovative approaches and solutions within the project, with a focus on introducing fresh perspectives or methods.
3. _Usage of Itheum Technology:_ Considering how well the project integrates or leverages Itheum technology at its core, emphasizing a meaningful connection with our technology stack.
4. _Real-world use cases:_ Evaluating the practicality and applicability of the project in real-world scenarios, particularly its potential to address real-world problems or needs.
5. _Working prototype:_ Seeking evidence of a functional prototype or proof of concept for the project, demonstrating tangible progress or a working model.

Once a project meets the evaluation criteria, they will be eligible for the next round where they apply through the application form and indicate the desired level of support.

_Note:_ Please be aware that the selection of projects for each individual Program is made at the discretion of the Itheum Team. Our team will make the final decisions based on the criteria mentioned above and other relevant factors.
