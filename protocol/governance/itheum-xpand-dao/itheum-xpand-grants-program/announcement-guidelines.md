# Announcement Guidelines

`Itheum xPand Grants Program` supports many teams and organizations throughout the ecosystem. We often receive requests to participate in project announcements. Unfortunately, due to the high volume of requests, we rarely do joint announcements but will be happy to cross promote the most innovative projects using our social channels.

In the context of the grants programs, we ask teams not to make any announcements before _**the first milestone has been accepted**_. This is in order to protect the community from projects that only intend to use the grant announcement to raise support and/or interest but don't intend to deliver the completed projects. For this reason, we reserve the right to terminate grants if this rule is not observed.

Once you have completed your milestone, we can help by reviewing and proofreading your blog post. When you have drafted your announcement, send it to [our discord.](https://itheum.io/discord)

Please allow 1-3 working days where possible for proofreading articles and wait until the milestone has been accepted to publish it.

We also cross-promote the most recent projects and their milestones on Twitter, so please keep us updated and send us the links to your published tweets regarding your announcements and we will amplify using our marketing channels.

### We recommend the following guidelines when writing your marketing posts

* The posts should be strategic in nature, focusing on the tech rather than the "announcement" element.
* The team should point to the work to attract attention to the project and demonstrate momentum in the ecosystem. It should be informative for builders and the larger community.
* Suggested flow for the post:
  * This is what the team has built so far.
  * These are the team's future development plans.
  * This is how the technology will contribute to the Itheum ecosystem.

### Key Components

1.  **A blog post header image**

    * An image helps when sharing the announcement on social networks. It's more prominent in feeds and looks more professional.
    * Image ideas include showing how this grants program or Itheum fits into your flow. Or you can simply put the teams logos next to each other.


2.  **About your team**

    * This is a chance to share more about your project and what it does.
    * You can also highlight additional use cases for this new integration.


3.  **Why you choose to build on this tech stack**

    * Illustrate the rationale for the relationship - why did you decide to work with Itheum Protocol?
    * Describe the benefits of building on Itheum Protocol (security, ease of use, ease of deployment, decentralized, trusted, etc.) and why it was it important to have these features for your project.



    4.  **Quote**

        * Your CEO / CTO / Founder may want to include a quote of why they picked the `Itheum xPand Grants Program` to help gain more visibility and traction in the market.


    5. **Social Connections**
       * The following text regarding Itheum's social presence can be added at the end of your article: "Learn more about Itheum by visiting their [website](https://itheum.io), and stay up to date with the latest developments by following them on [Medium](https://medium.com/itheum) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/itheum)."

### Recommended language

1. Use specific verbs such as integrate, support, or build and the #BuildOnItheum must be used
2. Using Itheum's Software Development Kit ( SDK ) under the hood.
3. Don't use descriptors like partner/partnership, collaborations, affiliate, strategic or long-term in these announcements—due to the various and evolving ways `Itheum xPand Grants Program` works with the ecosystem.
4. Don't describe your technology as the "first" to build on Itheum—the timing for launch implementations across all our projects is indefinite.
5. Don't indicate that Itheum prefers a certain technology over all others:
   * As such, do not use: "Itheum recommends that teams use this tech to build X"
   * Instead, speak of the merits of the tech: "This technology provides great utility for the Itheum network through..."
6. Follow our [content-guidelines.md](../../../../legal/content-guidelines.md "mention") rules and recommendations.

We look forward to working with you in creating the next generation of the internet! If you have any questions or would like to be included in our next announcement, please reach out to us via [Discord](https://itheum.io/discord).
