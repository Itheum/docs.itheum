# Phase 1 : Token Burn Program

## Burn Details

{% hint style="success" %}
15% of the ITHEUM max supply will be burned over a maximum 3 months (90 days), equating to 150,000,000 ITHEUM tokens. This reduces the max supply from 1 billion to 850 million. The total burn can be sped up to 1.5 months (45 days) if public usage of the protocol triggers a "boosted burn" rate.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Where the tokens come from - Breakdown:**

* Treasury: 7.00% (70,000,000 tokens)
* Team/Advisory: 3.00% (30,000,000 tokens)
* Ecosystem: 2.75% (27,500,000 tokens)
* Community: 2.25% (22,500,000 tokens)

**Daily Burn Rate:**

* A daily **base burn rate** of 0.16% (1,666,667 tokens) is applied. However, based on some usage metrics of the protocol, a **boosted burn rate** of up to 0.33% (3,333,333 tokens) can take effect â€” speeding up the daily burn.
* With the boosted burn rate, the entire burn process could be completed in 45 days instead of 90 days.
* Once 150,000,000 ITHEUM tokens are burned, regardless on if this happens at any time within 90 days, then the this burn program will end

This **dynamic boosted mechanism** empowers the community to actively participate in accelerating the burn by engaging with the Itheum protocol.



## How the Burn Program Was Proposed and Passed

The idea for the token burn program originated within our DAO on November 11th 2024. We invited the community to contribute to the discussion, ensuring alignment with our decentralized governance ethos.

## Burn Process & Burn Audit

* Token burning will happen weekly (or worse case fortnightly). Each burn event will be called a "round"
* Our community will be publicly notified on the burn rate for the week and how it was calculated (as the burn amount is dynamic and linked to protocol usage)
* To ensure it's all done transparently and can be monitored by anyone, burn transactions can be seen on the official Itheum burn wallet : [https://explorer.multiversx.com/accounts/erd17exmcvh0wm2xx9ngas84vd3jyc4zgf6scg75tmncff6k3qnxux0qzw0mrf](https://explorer.multiversx.com/accounts/erd17exmcvh0wm2xx9ngas84vd3jyc4zgf6scg75tmncff6k3qnxux0qzw0mrf)
* Burn transactions per round are as follows:

| Round          | Date        | Total Burned | Burn TX                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
