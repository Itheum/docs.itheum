# Phase 1 : Token Burn Program

## Burn Details

{% hint style="success" %}
15% of the ITHEUM max supply will be burned over a maximum 3 months (90 days), equating to 150,000,000 ITHEUM tokens. This reduces the max supply from 1 billion to 850 million. The total burn can be sped up to 1.5 months (45 days) if public usage of the protocol triggers a "boosted burn" rate.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**Where the tokens come from - Breakdown:**

* Treasury: 7.00% (70,000,000 tokens)
* Team/Advisory: 3.00% (30,000,000 tokens)
* Ecosystem: 2.75% (27,500,000 tokens)
* Community: 2.25% (22,500,000 tokens)

**Daily Burn Rate:**

* The daily burn can be tracked live here:[ Token Analytics Dashboard](https://explorer.itheum.io/analytics)
* A daily **base burn rate** of 0.16% (1,666,667 tokens) is applied. However, based on the last seven days’ usage of Data NFTs and the growth of Liveliness TVL, a **boosted burn rate** of up to 0.33% (3,333,333 tokens) can take effect — speeding up the daily burn.
* With the boosted burn rate, the entire burn process could be completed in 45 days instead of 90 days.
* Once 150,000,000 ITHEUM tokens are burned, regardless on if this happens at any time within 90 days, then the this burn program will end

This **dynamic boosted mechanism** empowers the community to actively participate in accelerating the burn by engaging with the Itheum protocol.



## How the Burn Program Was Proposed and Passed

The discussion and vote is currently underway on the Itheum Ecosystem DAO and is expected to be voted on soon. Participate here : [https://peerme.io/itheum-ecosystem-dao](https://peerme.io/itheum-ecosystem-dao)
