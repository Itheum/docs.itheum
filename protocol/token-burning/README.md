# ðŸ§¨ Token Burning

## **Introducing the $ITHEUM Token Burn Program**

The Itheum protocol is at the forefront of creating the human reputation and data layer for the AI era. Our innovative NFMeID and Liveliness Staking products define the human reputation component, while our unique Data NFT technology powers the data layer. Together, they form the core of Itheumâ€™s mission to empower individuals and organizations in the new AI-driven landscape.

As [detailed in our latest light paper](https://api.itheumcloud.com/files_misc/Itheum-Protocol-One-Pager-Litepaper.pdf), we have realigned token utility to support these flagship products effectively.&#x20;

With all token vesting now completed and over 55% of the 1 billion ITHEUM tokens in circulation, weâ€™ve identified a need to restore the tokenâ€™s reputation and align it with the revised tokenomics. This is especially important as we move to realigning the tokenâ€™s utility to the music hyped AI Agent era. A key strategy to achieve this is through a token burn programâ€”a move that will increase scarcity and stabilize tokenomics as protocol usage grows.&#x20;

Today, weâ€™re excited to announce **Phase 1** of our token burn program.\

Let's explore Phase 1 of this program...
