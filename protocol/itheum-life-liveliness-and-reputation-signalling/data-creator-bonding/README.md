As explained in the intro page [..](../ "mention"), Itheum “Liveliness” scores are a measurement of your reputation, participation, activity, and advocacy of the new data economy.

For Data Creators (i.e. Data NFT Minters), “Liveliness'  scores are established during the Data NFT minting process, where the creator will need to deposit a **Slashable Bond** (**sBond**) for a DAO-determined **“Bond period” (e.g. 3 Months).** After doing so, the Creator can mint their own data as Data NFTs. The Liveliness scores “depletes” as we reach closer to the “**Bond Period**” expiry date, effectively this signals to Data Consumers that the Creator is “active” and has a stake in the game for any bar behavior. \

If a Data Creator exits their **sBond** before the "**Bond Period**", they will be slashed and lose a majority of their Bond which is then distributed back to any existing Data Consumer who may be impacted by this event.&#x20;

\
A Creator may also exit their **sBond** position for any reason, maybe they wanted to exit the Itheum Protocol ecosystem for a valid reason like a lack of time to commit or maybe they could be a BOT or bad actor who wants to use some hype and leverage this to exploit Data Consumers if they exit they are slashed and this provides some disincentive for them to exist.&#x20;

The Data Consumer can choose to keep renewing their **sBond** as many times as needed, each time they do this, their liveliness scores reset to 100%. Once again this act signals to Data Consumers that the Creator is “here to stay” and this improves their reputation and hence, the value of their data. But the Data Creator can also choose to withdraw their Bond without any penalty after the minimum **Bond Period** has expired. This will drop their Liveliness score to zero and this will be shown to new Data Consumers, who can then make an informed decision on if they want to continue to support the work of this creator.

Data Consumers are also provided an option to “report” a Data Creator who may exhibit some bad behavior, the report is made to a Data Curation DAO, which then has the power to enforce some smaller penalties for minor offenses (like the Data Stream being offline a few times), or they can enforce a large slash for major offenses (like the Data Stream being taken offline completely or replaced with bad content).&#x20;

### E**xamples: Bad Actors vs Good Actors:**

1. Alice is an Indie Musician looking to generate a strong fan following.
2. Bob is an active PlayStation gamer who has aspirations to become a competitive gamer and plays games many hours a day generating a lot of valuable gamer data.
3. Carol likes to stay healthy and active and spends a lot of time in fitness and wellness activities, generating a lot of valuable health data.
4. David runs a company that wants to tokenize shopping behavior and tie it to a tradable loyalty card.

{% hint style="success" %}
Alice, Bob, Carol, and David are Data Creators who are “Good Actors” and they want to use the itheum protocol to meet their objective of getting rewarded for their high-value data. They want to build their reputation and show their users that they are active and have strong “liveliness”. They deposit bonds as Data Creators mint their Data NFTs and keep renewing their Bonds to ensure they have a maximum Liveliness Score. The Data Consumers feel comfortable getting access to their data given it’s obvious they are good actors.
{% endhint %}

5. Elle is a BOT, it wants to try and offload nefarious data to unsuspecting Data Consumers.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Elle is a “Bad Actor”. Data Consumers suspect this and raise a report with the Data Curation DAO who then warns Elle via a minor penalty on the Bond, and if not corrected, Slashes the entire bond and freezes the Data NFTs in Elle’s collection. The slashed bond amounts are then reimbursed to any Data Consumer impacted by this event.
