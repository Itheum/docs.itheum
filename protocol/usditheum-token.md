## Token Utility

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="338">Utility</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><h4>Mint Data NFTs</h4></td><td>Bond and stake $ITHEUM to obtain 'Liveliness' and become a 'Data Creator' with on-chain reputation. This then enables you to mint Data NFTs to tokenize and trade your data. <strong>Liveliness bonds also earn real-yield rewards from protocol revenue</strong></td></tr><tr><td><h4>Prove your "Liveliness"</h4></td><td>Anyone can bond and stake $ITHEUM into the protocol to obtain a 'Liveliness' score that is relative to your bonded position. Liveliness is a form of 'proof of humanity' and is used to assess the value of your data. <strong>Liveliness bonds earn real-yield rewards from protocol revenue.</strong></td></tr><tr><td><h4>Launch Data Coalition DAOs</h4></td><td>Bond $ITHEUM to launch and operate bulk data collection and curating Data Coalition DAOs that broker data trades with AI companies.</td></tr><tr><td><h4>Get Governance Voting Privileges</h4></td><td>Obtain voting privileges relative to your $ITHEUM-bonded 'Liveliness' in order to govern key operational metrics of the entire Itheum Protocol.</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Explanation of the Cliff / Vest / Unlock process:**

* **Cliff (C):** The period when tokens are fully locked.
* **Vest (V):** After the cliff is over, then the tokens can be claimed. The claimable tokens are then allocated at a fixed schedule over time. This is called a vesting schedule.
* **Unlock (U):** The vested/allocated tokens then unlocks at certain points. This is when the token holder can get access to their vested tokens.

**Let's consider the following example:**

`Private Sale: 20% of max supply : V:24m / U:3m : TGE unlock 5%`

1. Receive 5% of their tokens at the token generation event (TGE), which occurred on March 28, 2022.
2. The remaining 95% of their tokens are released progressively over a vesting period of 24 months (V:24m).
3. During the 24-month vesting period, purchasers will be able to get access to their tokens in 3 months blocks - this is called the unlock period (U:3m). The **1st unlock date for the purchasers will be June 28, 2022.**

_**Unlock Dates:**_

* June 28, 2022 (start)
* Sep 28, 2022
* Dec 28, 2022
* Mar 28, 2023
* Jun 28, 2023
* Sep 28, 2023
* Dec 28, 2023
* March 28, 2024 (end)

**Why did Itheum design the token distribution schedule this way?**

* Itheum needs a long-term commitment from our supporters and this assures we get this from the team, strategic partners, and advisors.
* Itheum's token is a utility token that is used to "price" the access to data, effectively setting a "value" for data. To ensure stability for the network, Itheum will put in place the "3-month" unlock mechanism that applies after the cliff and vest dates pass.



Vesting Status: **We are currently at Month 27 : July 2024**

## Token Distribution

As with all blockchain-based projects; Itheum will have an allocation of tokens that are not for sale. These non-sale tokens will be allocated to various buckets to oversee the roadmap, community, partners, liquidity, security, and various incentives needed for the continued growth of the Itheum ecosystem and to ensure we build a platform that becomes a market leader, brings the best value to the community and eventually be governed by the community.&#x20;

The non-sale allocation groups and their initiatives are as follows _(please be aware that the full initiatives under the groups an evolving topic of discussion between the protocol and community governance, but we aim to cover the following key items as a minimum)_:

### Community (17%) & Ecosystem (23.5%)

* Ambassador programs
* Community growth campaigns
* Community education campaigns
* Community feature testing rewards (Beta feature user testing)
* Development grants, hackathons & incentives
* Grants to run **Data Coalition DAOs**
* Grants to build apps on Itheum's **App Store:** [**https://explorer.itheum.io**](https://explorer.itheum.io/)
* Ongoing multi-chain liquidity reserves
* Technical audits and white-hat hacking bounty programs, code reviews, and platform stability incentives
* Home of the **Community Treasury**: holds the percentage of funds earned from Data NFT trade fees that will be reserved real-yield distribution to ITHEUM stakers and/or "buy-back and burn" programs

### Data Partners (2.5% - this is part of the Ecosystem bucket)

* Key partnerships to enable "data market-making" (i.e. to ensure there is a constant demand for data)
* Recruitment of a **consumer data protection guild** - These are global SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) in data privacy, data regulation, personal data protection advocacy, academia, and law. The **consumer data protection guild** will be available for **Data Coalitions DOAs** to utilize as needed to ensure that data trade happening via Itheum is always in the best interest of all parties' rights

### Treasury (17%)

* Home of the **Foundation Treasury**: funds are used to support Itheum's roadmap for the long term and will be eventually be controlled by the **Itheum Foundation DAO**
* Funds to cover unexpected expenses that might come up relating to platform operations, stability, security, and growth

### Team & Advisors - 17.5%

* Team (12%): Incentivise the core team and new team members to work and deliver the initial roadmap (until the community-run Itheum Foundation DAO is put into place)
* Advisors (5.5%): Strategic advisors who will help Itheum bootstrap and reach optimum global growth
