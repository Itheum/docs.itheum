# 👋 Getting Started

{% hint style="warning" %}
Itheum is implementing deflationary tokenomics and conducting weekly $ITHEUM token burns triggered by increasing protocol usage. The aim is to increase token scarcity and align the token with our use case for agentic data tokenization and for the token to transition to it's governance utility.\

#### Introducing Itheum: Unlocking the Value of Your Data in the AI Era

Every click, every like, every purchase, every playlist—your online actions generate valuable personal data. This data isn’t just floating around; it’s being collected by big corporations and used to train AI models and agents that are reshaping our world.

Here’s the problem: while your data is powering a rapidly growing AI-first world, you don’t own it, control it, or benefit from its value.

#### The AI Revolution Needs You

AI agents are becoming a dominant force on social platforms, vying for attention and driving engagement. Meanwhile, crypto-based AI infrastructures like Truth Terminal, AI16Z, and Zerebro are taking center stage. But these systems have major limitations:

* **Centralized control:** Most AI agents are controlled by a handful of developers.
* **Limited data sources:** They rely on pre-selected data rather than diverse, real-world inputs.
* **No human connection:** There’s no streamlined way to onboard humans to contribute data or offer feedback.

#### Enter Itheum: Empowering You in the AI Economy

Itheum transforms this paradigm by creating a bridge between humans and AI agents. Imagine a world where:

* **Your data is yours:** You retain control and consent over how it’s used.
* **AI agents evolve with your input:** Using Itheum’s “on-chain” infrastructure, agents access real human-sourced data and feedback.
* **You get rewarded:** Humans become an **AI Data Workforce**, earning value for contributing data, engagement, and insights.

With Itheum’s latest protocol upgrade, we’ve built the data infrastructure that enables AI agents to grow smarter while empowering people to monetize their data and attention.
