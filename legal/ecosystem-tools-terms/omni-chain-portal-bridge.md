## Portal Bridge Terms of Use

* **Decentralized Nature**: The Portal Bridge is a decentralized application. As such, it operates without any central authority. Users are responsible for their own actions and transactions conducted via the Portal Bridge.

* **User Responsibility**: You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your wallet and private keys. We do not have access to or control over your private keys and cannot assist in the recovery of lost keys or tokens.
* **Prohibited Activities**: You agree not to use the Portal Bridge for any illegal or unauthorized activities, including but not limited to money laundering, terrorist financing, and any other activities prohibited by applicable laws and regulations.
* **Transaction Fees**: Transactions conducted via the Portal Bridge may be subject to fees, which will be clearly disclosed to you before you complete any transaction. You agree to pay all applicable fees.
* **No Liability**: To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Portal Bridge.
* **Modifications**: We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the Portal Bridge at any time without notice. We may also modify these terms of use from time to time. Your continued use of the Portal Bridge after any modifications constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.
* **Governing Law**: These terms of use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Portal Bridge operates, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
* **Third-Party Software**: The Portal Bridge uses third-party software to operate. The security of these components is beyond our control, and we cannot be held liable for any loss of $ITHEUM tokens due to the security and technology risks of these platforms.
* **Support Systems**: The Portal Bridge uses support systems to improve the user experience by showing recent transactions. These systems only store your public wallet address, the amount you attempted to bridge, and public transaction hashes from the supported blockchains. All information stored in the support systems is fully public on blockchain explorers, and you consent to the storage of these same public details.
* **Liquidity-Based System**: The Portal Bridge uses a liquidity-based system for token bridging. There may be situations where, if your tokens are being bridged and the liquidity levels run low concurrently due to usage by other users, the bridge will not be able to process the transactions. In this event, please reach out to us on the dedicated Bridge Support channel on our Discord: [itheum.io/discord](https://itheum.io/discord), and we will assist you in debugging and processing the halted transaction.
* **Transaction Delays**: Due to factors beyond our control (blockchain congestion, gas hikes, and other third-party software issues), the Portal Bridge does not provide a dedicated SLA for when the tokens will be bridged between blockchains and reach your cryptocurrency wallet. It generally takes anywhere between 3 to 20 minutes for the transaction to complete. If you experience any abnormal bridging time delays, please reach out to us on the dedicated Bridge Support channel on our Discord: [itheum.io/discord](https://itheum.io/discord), and we will assist you in debugging and processing the delayed transaction.
* **Gas Fees**: The gas cost to deposit your $ITHEUM tokens into the smart contract on the source chain (i.e., the chain you are trying to bridge from) should be covered by you. You should provide the appropriate gas fees to ensure your transaction is processed and not backlogged, neglected, or rejected by the blockchain validators due to it being too low.
* **Itheum Protocol and Platform Disclaimers**: The usage of the Portal Bridge is also subject to the disclaimers mentioned in the Itheum protocol/platform whitepaper and $ITHEUM token disclaimers. Please review the disclaimers at [Itheum Whitepaper Disclaimers](https://dev.to/itheum/itheum-data-dex-whitepaper-ooo#disclaimers).
* **General Risk**: The usage of the Portal Bridge is also subject to the general risk of using the Itheum protocol/platform as mentioned in the Itheum whitepaper. Please review the risks at [Itheum Whitepaper Risks](https://dev.to/itheum/itheum-data-dex-whitepaper-ooo#risks).
