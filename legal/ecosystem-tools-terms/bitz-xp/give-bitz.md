# Give BiTz

## Give BiTz Terms of Use

1. You understand and accept that once you give your BiTz XP to Data Creators or Data Bounties, you cannot claim it back or get a refund. The actions are "one-way" and none reversible.
2. You understand and accept that once you give your BiTz XP to Data Creators or Data Bounties, your available BiTz XP points balance will be "reduced" and this action is non-reversible. Your BiTz XP points balance is the sum of your Get BiTz points minus the Sum of your Give BiTz balance.
3. You understand and accept that if you give BiTz XP to a Data Creator's campaign, this action does not guarantee that the Creator's advertised perks will be filled (as this is an open system that is not centrally controlled and enforced). If you are impacted by this, you can raise it with the [Itheum Trailblazer DAO](https://peerme.io/itheum-trailblazer-dao/discuss) and some follow-up actions may be taken against the Data Creator. But you do acknowledge and accept the risk that the Data Creator may not fulfill their obligations as advertised by them in the Get BiTz web app.
4. You understand and accept that if you give BiTz XP to a Data Bounty and it's filled by a Data Creator, this action does not guarantee that the Bounty's advertised perks will be filled (as this is an open system that is not centrally controlled and enforced). If you are impacted by this, you can raise it with the Itheum [Trailblazer DAO](https://peerme.io/itheum-trailblazer-dao/discuss) and some follow-up actions may be taken against the Data Creator. But you do acknowledge and accept the risk that the Data Creator may not fulfill their obligations as advertised by them in the Get BiTz web app.
5. You understand and accept that if you give BiTz XP to a Data Creator's campaign there is a possibility that the Data Creator will never launch a new Data NFT collection and therefore you lose your ability to receive any of the advertised perks, as they are only applicable to new Data NFT collection the Data Creator launches as part of their campaign.
6. You understand and accept that if you give BiTz XP to a Data Bounty there is a possibility that the Data Bounty is never filled and therefore you will be able to receive any of the advertised perks, as they are only applicable to Data Bounties that get filled.
