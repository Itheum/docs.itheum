# Gamer Passport

## Gamer Passport Terms of Use

1. **Opt-In System**
   1. The Gamer Passport is an opt-in system where users, who engage in gaming, can choose to participate.
2. **Data Collection and Storage Notification**
   1. Prior to joining, you have been fully informed about the type of data collected and storage details, which are outlined at [data-collection-and-storage.md](data-collection-and-storage.md "mention"). By signing up for the Gamer Passport, you agree to these terms.
3. **Rewards Program**
   1. Rewards will be provided to participants, but the exact calculation method and distribution date is at our discretion. Due to the early-stage nature of this application, rewards may be based on a combination of metrics such as duration in the program, amount of data generated and shared, gaming performance, app engagement, and other evolving metrics.
4. **Use of Collected Data**
   1. The data collected, as detailed at [data-collection-and-storage.md](data-collection-and-storage.md "mention"), will be used internally to create data analytics reports. These reports will be fully de-identified and may be publicly demonstrated to showcase the value of the Gamer Passport program. Data insights, analytics, and information will not be sold without prior consent from participants, likely through a collective vote regarding the decision and profit-sharing.
5. **Opting Out**
   1. You can opt out at any time by emailing <mark style="background-color:blue;">**privacy@itheum.io**</mark> with a short note, including your gaming platform username (e.g., PlayStation username), blockchain wallet used to sign up (e.g., Solana wallet), and any other relevant details. You may be required to verify your identity before we proceed with the deletion of your data. We will remove all your data from the system within 30 days of identity confirmation. For data stored in decentralized storage solutions (as mentioned at [data-collection-and-storage.md](data-collection-and-storage.md "mention")), only data stored outside of the decentralized storage can be deleted immediately. De-identified, encrypted data may remain in decentralized storage until it is naturally purged by the storage protocol (e.g., IPFS).
6. **User Responsibilities**
   1. Users must ensure the accuracy of the information provided and keep their account details secure.
   2. Users must comply with all applicable laws and regulations while using the app.
7. **Changes to Terms**
   1. We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Users will be notified of any changes, and continued use of the app implies acceptance of the new terms.
8. **Limitation of Liability**
   1. We are not liable for any damages or losses arising from the use of the app. The app is provided "as is" without any warranties.
9. **Contact Information**
   1. For any questions or concerns regarding these terms, please contact us at <mark style="background-color:blue;">**privacy@itheum.io**</mark>
