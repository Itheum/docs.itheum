# Building the Ecosystem: Consumer Apps and Distribution

Aithra’s adoption will grow through ecosystem apps that bring its power to end-users. Two such apps are Sigma Music (Live) and Agenta (In Development) - autonomous projects with their own roadmaps and network tokens. Sigma Music showcases Itheum’s potential in music data tokenization and IP licensing. Agenta expands into AI agent data flows, enabling real-time agentic commerce.
