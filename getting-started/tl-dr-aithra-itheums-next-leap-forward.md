<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (187).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Since 2018, Itheum has been building toward a world where data is owned, not extracted. With Itheum Aithra (V3), we unify seven years of learnings - from healthcare data ownership to Data NFTs to AI data tokenization - into one mission: to create a **full-stack Abstraction + Unification blockchain protocol layer** for data tokenization, storage, encryption, and IP licensing that powers the hyper-digital AGI data economy.



* Why now: AI has reached the limits of public web data. The world is now moving beyond digital - into the hyper-digital era, where data must be private, permissioned, and verifiably owned.
* What Aithra does: Provides developers, builders, and AI agents with a unified way to source, tokenize, encrypt, and license data - enabling the creation of hyper-digital data assets ready for intelligent systems and agent economies.
* Commercial model: Open-source infrastructure powered by public goods, complemented by enterprise-grade Gateways for organizations seeking web2-friendly access.
* Token updates: The $ITHEUM token evolves into a governance-focused utility, reinforcing community ownership and scarcity through planned burns and protocol alignment.
* Roadmap: Gateway (Q3 2025) → Workspace UI (Q4 2025) → SDK + MCP (Q1 2026)
