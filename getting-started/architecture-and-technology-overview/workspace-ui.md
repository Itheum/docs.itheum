# Workspace UI

Aithra Workspace is a clean, intuitive web interface that lets anyone turn ordinary files into hyper-digital data assets - tokenized, privacy-controlled, and ready for the AGI-driven data economy.

With a simple drag-and-drop upload, users can instantly begin shaping their data into something much more powerful. Each step in the Workspace flow adds optional intelligence and control - from how files are stored, encrypted, or shared, to whether they can be tokenized, licensed, or even used for federated AI learning.

You can:

* **Upload files** in any format - from images and audio to structured data.
* **Set storage preferences** (static or dynamic) to control mutability.
* **Add encryption and privacy settings** to decide who can access your data.
* **Tokenize your asset** to make it ownable and tradable.
* **Attach IP licensing** to define how others can use it - including options for creative, commercial, or AI-training rights.
* **Enable federated learning** to let AI systems train on your data and pay you for it.

When finished, Aithra Workspace presents a **clear summary and cost breakdown** before you complete payment in USDC - making it transparent and predictable to publish your data on-chain.

The result: a seamless, web3-native experience that transforms your everyday digital files into **sovereign, monetizable data assets** - assets built for the emerging **AGI era**, where data ownership, privacy, and value all converge.
