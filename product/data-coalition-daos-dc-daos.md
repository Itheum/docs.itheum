# üó≥Ô∏è Data Coalition DAOs (DC DAOs)

Data Coalition DAOs revolutionize the trading of personal data by pooling similar data into valuable clusters. This collective approach significantly boosts data worth, making it ideal for deep analysis and AI training. These decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are governed by board members, who bond $ITHEUM tokens, ensuring alignment with member interests and incentivizing robust data management.

Board members, as creators of Data Coalitions, hold stakes in the game, driving them to act in members' best interests. Successful Coalitions, envisioned to be run by enterprises and subject matter experts, balance data commercialization with end-user accountability. Members align with Coalitions that reflect their interests, delegating data ownership for collective benefit and steady returns.

Furthermore, Data Coalitions allow token staking for support and signal quality data without sharing personal information. All participants, including board members, data contributors, and token stakers, earn micropayments proportional to their involvement. This innovative model aligns with the Credit Union Philosophy, fostering trust and community-driven data management.

Data Coalition DAOs will be initially enabled via direct integration on the Itheum Protocol with the [PeerMe DAO ecosystem](https://peerme.io/) of tooling and this has already been achieved. The first Data Coalition DAOs will be launching very soon so watch this space!
