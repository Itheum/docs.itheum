# CanaryNet Guardrails

CanaryNet "[_Guardrails_](https://datadex.itheum.io/guardRails)" are put in place to protect users in the ecosystem while allowing real-world usage of the technology. These guardrails include whitelisted data creator minting, time limits between new Data NFT minting, anti-spam tax, community-based curation, and more. As the technology matures and gains acceptance, it is anticipated that guardrails will be removed progressively, thereby enabling unrestricted usage and adoption of Itheum's technology.&#x20;

"_CanaryNet_" aims to protect end-users and position Itheum's technology for mainstream adoption while adhering to regulation and operational excellence.
