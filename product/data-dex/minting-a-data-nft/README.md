# Minting a Data NFT

Organizations or entities can use the tool provided by the Data DEX to mint their Data NFTs and put them for trade in the Data NFT Marketplace. High-value datasets or Data Streams can be assembled for minting and these can be of various formats; JSON, PDF, JPG, PNG, GIF, MP3, MP4, CSV, and so on. Tags will further categorize these Data NFTs to enable consumers to locate and consume these datasets.
