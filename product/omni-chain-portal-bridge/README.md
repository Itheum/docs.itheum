* The Omni-Chain Portal Bridge is the itheum Protcol's official bridge and the Mainnet version is available at [http://portal.itheum.io ](https://portal.itheum.io/)
* It currently allows any user to bridge $ITHEUM tokens between MultiversX and Solana (in both directions)
* The bridge is an "LP bridge", which uses Liquidity Pools on both chains to supply ITHEUM tokens on each chain. LP bridges are more secure than regular mint/burn bridges, but they also have some limitations - mainly related to smaller bridging limits and manual balancing of supply.
  * Note that there is a Minimum and Maximum Deposit amount that is specified in the "Bridge Settings" header. At this stage, it's 10 ITHEUM minimum and 100,000 ITHEUM minimum that can be bridged in a single transaction. This can change in the future.
* Keep a close eye on the "Bridge Operations" panel, which gives you some useful insights into the "health" of the bridge. If there are some delays in processing, an alert will be shown here and you can then make an informed decision on if you want to process or not.
* Token Transactions generally bridge from one chain to the other in around 3-6 EPOCHs, and each epoch is 3 mins, so your tokens should transfer between 9 - 18 minutes. Sometimes it will be faster and at times with high congestion, it can be slower.&#x20;
* Currently, there is a small fee (0.05 EGLD ) to move ITHEUM from MultiversX to Solana but a zero fee to move tokens from Solana to MultiversX. This can change in the future.
* Do you want to test the Bridge before using it on Mainnet? You can our devnet bridge on [https://alpha-devnet.portal.itheum.io](https://alpha-devnet.portal.itheum.io/) and try it out. On MultiversX this uses the "devnet" and on Solana it uses the "testnet".&#x20;
* If you have any issuers during bridging you can use our dedicated Support process as per [portal-bridge-support.md](../../developers/tech-support-discord/portal-bridge-support.md "mention")
