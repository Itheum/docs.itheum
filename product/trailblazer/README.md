The Trailblazer (TB) is a specialized Data NFT designed to leverage the capabilities of the Data NFT technology. It serves as a community engagement tool for organizations to interact with their users through exclusive events, campaigns, meetups, discounts, and more. The TB is minted within the Data NFT Marketplace. Organizations and projects can have their own Trailblazer.

The project or organization owning the Trailblazer Data NFT is provided with a CSV **template/structure/schema** whereby they will be able to update events and activities. The CSV is then processed and hosted via JSON in AWS as a data stream.

The Data NFT is then listed and made available for procurement from the Data NFT Marketplace. Upon procuring the Trailblazer Data NFT, the buyer now has gated access to the data stream. They can choose to view the raw data or visit the Trailblazer App on the Itheum Explorer and access a visual representation of the contents of the Data NFT.
