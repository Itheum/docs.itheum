## Introduction

Itheum “Liveliness” scores are a measurement of your reputation, participation, activity, and advocacy of the new data economy. It puts in place the crypto-economic game-theory principles like bonding, penalties, rewards, and slashing to ensure that good behavior is rewarded and bad behavior is penalized. Itheum Protocol’s central utility token, ITHEUM will be at the heart of this “Liveliness” mechanism.\


The Itheum Protocol will have various mechanisms to determine the Liveliness of various participants. From Data Creators who generate data to Data Consumers who consume data to dApps that use Itheum Infrastructure, to Data Coalitions DAOs that bulk trade data, and to the general web3 community who can signal support for any of the above-mentioned user bases (e.g. stake to support a Data Creator), to even the everyday web2 community who does not care about blockchain technology and can use Itheum protocol tools to generate XP as they do in any other game or social platform. All of these Liveliness mechanisms are collectively called “**Itheum Life**' framework.
