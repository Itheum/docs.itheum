# Token Utility for the AI Data Workforce

Weâ€™ve designed a reward-driven token utility that powers the AI Data Workforce and ensures participants are fairly rewarded for their contributions. The **Workforce Rewards Treasury** is at the center of this system, enabling two primary pathways to earn rewards:

Workforce Rewards Treasury - The Treasury acts as the reward pool where $ITHEUM tokens are distributed back to participants based on their engagement and contributions.

1. **Liveliness Staking Rewards:** Grow your Liveliness Score by bonding $ITHEUM tokens to your NFMe ID. A higher Liveliness Score unlocks better rewards claims, reflecting your active role and reputation in the workforce.
2. **Protocol Usage (Badges) Rewards:** Earn bonus rewards by participating actively and achieving milestones within the AI Data Workforce. Unlocking badges not only boosts your contribution visibility but also provides additional rewards.
