theum launched Data NFTs on the mainnet, inviting top creators from across the ecosystem to license and share their work. The response was greatâ€”we onboarded on-chain analysts, DeFi educators, musicians, game developers, and more. But we noticed a gap: not everyone was a content creator.

To bridge this, we created the NFMe ID Vault and Liveliness Staking, making it easy for anyone to join the Data Economy. With a few clicks, you can mint your NFMe ID Vault, build your Web3 reputation, and earn rewards.

Now, anyone can easily become a data creator in the Itheum Ecosystem!

### Why should you mint your NFMe ID Vault Data NFT?

When you do, you bond $ITHEUM tokens to build your Liveliness score, which reflects your Web3 Reputation. This score grows as your bond increases. Plus, with the new Liveliness Staking module, you can earn more $ITHEUM based on your bond and Liveliness score.

In other words, by bonding your $ITHEUM, you boost your Web3 reputation and earn rewards, all while becoming an active part of the Data NFT Ecosystem. Letâ€™s explore a few reasons to mint an NFMe ID Vault Data NFT:

* **Earn Rewards** from the first moment once your NFMe ID Vault is minted and set as primary through Liveliness Staking, generating more $ITHEUM tokens based on your total bond and Liveliness score.
* **Easy to Participate** as you donâ€™t need to be a content creator or a project. With less than 7 clicks, you can mint your NFMe ID Vault and start participating in the Data NFT Economy â€” anyone can join
* **Build Your Web3 Reputation** by minting your own NFMe ID and Topping up your $ITHEUM Bond on your NFMe ID Vault to generate a Liveliness score, which reflects your Web3 reputation.
* **Get Cool Opportunities** by minting once you earn 5 unique NFMe IDs, each as rare as regular NFTs. These can be connected to your Web2 and Web3 accounts, managed, or traded like regular NFTs.
* **Flexible Use** as your NFMe ID Vault can serve various roles â€” whether as a DeFi persona, NFT trading persona, or even a governance persona.
* **Future Competitions:** Be ready to use your minted NFMe IDs in upcoming competitions, adding an extra layer of engagement and fun.
