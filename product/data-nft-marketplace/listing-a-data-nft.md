# Listing a Data NFT

Upon minting or procuring a Data NFT, the Data NFT will be viewable in the "_Wallet_" on the [Data Dex](https://datadex.itheum.io/).

The user can then choose to list their Data NFT in the "_Market_" (Data NFT Marketplace).

The Owner has to set the following to list the NFT:

* _Number_ of NFTs to list (If you had minted multiple copies, how many you would like to list in a single offer)
* The List Price or _Unlock Fee_ per unit (if you had minted multiple copies and you would like to list multiple copies in a single offer, then this is the fee per copy)
* Max buy per address limits the number of NFTs a single user can buy during 1 transaction.

Upon invoking the listing, the owner is prompted with a confirmation message that provides a summary and breakdown of the fee split.

Prior to listing, an uptime check is performed to validate the real-time uptime availability of the Data Stream. If the stream is detected to be live, the owner must read and agree to the _Terms of Use_. Upon proceeding, the owner has to sign a transaction to finalize the listing in the marketplace.\

Once the listing is successfully completed, you can head over to the "_Market_" (Data NFT Marketplace) to view your offer. Here you will be able to use the "_My Listed Data NFT(s)_" tab to view your listed Data NFTs and "De-List" them or "Update Price" on them at any time.&#x20;
